# SEO Code Refactor

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The purpose of the project was to adjust the existing code to provide several improvements for a client. I replaced div markers with semantic elements so that the purpose
- of each portion of the code is clear to both the browser and anyone viewing the code. I ensured the headings are in sequential order and that all image elements
- have alt text for accessibility. I also added a concise title so that a tab on a browser clearly displays the client name and alludes to the content on the page. 
- The project was very helpful for me because it broadened my understanding of the different semantic elements - particularly when and how to use each of them. 

- 
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
